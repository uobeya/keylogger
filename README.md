# keylogger
This C# keylogger script captures keyboard inputs covertly, logging user keystrokes into a file or database. It hooks into the system's input events, records pressed keys, and timestamps them, potentially used for monitoring or security purposes. However, ethical considerations and legal compliance are essential due to potential privacy concerns
